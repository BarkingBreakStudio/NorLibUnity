# Norlib Open Project

This is my personal library for Unity Code. I find myself writing the same code over and over again in different Projects. My goal with this library is to never write the same code twice again.
And I have a lot of fun writing librarys componeint, that do single tasks very well instead of prograjmming a whoile game. This library is heavily by the Unity Open Project CHop Chop. 

## Instruction

This repo is designed to be used as a **subtree** in your Unity Project.
